I used ChatGPT-5 Thinking to solve the homework problems in part (3). I pasted the whole README.md file into the prompt 
and told it to follow the directions. The AI generally nailed it. However, in problem 1, I had to make some additions (I 
had to include "using hw2::fixed_point_iteration, using hw2::bisection; using hw2::newton_raphson;") at the top of the 
test_ai.cpp file to get it to compile correctly. For problem 2, the AI's attempt compiled without issue and gave (presumably)
correct answers. 

It is generally nice to have AI verify that my attempt was also correct, and that, in a pinch, I know I can rely on AI
to help me code accurately at a much faster pace. However, using AI without understanding how to have done the coding 
oneself generally leads to issues, since one ends up relying on AI completely and can't diagnose any coding bugs that arise
or modify the code themselves.
